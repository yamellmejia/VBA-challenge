# Quarterly Stock Change Summary

This Excel VBA script analyzes stock data for each quarter and calculates various data points for each stock ticker. The script outputs quarterly information and the percentage change between a given quarter's opening and closing prices. It also provides the total stock volume for each ticker. After considering all data for each quarter, the script identifies the stock with the highest percentage increase, the highest percentage decrease, and the highest total volume. 

The script iterates through the data on each worksheet and outputs quarterly information on the respective worksheet, facilitating a better understanding of the data found in each sheet. With this new data, another individual can draw conclusions about the stock for the given year without having to examine or go through a multitude of data.

The conditional formatting in the worksheets makes it easier to spot differences. The green and red highlighted cells indicate positive and negative changes in the ticker stocks, which could be crucial to know when looking at the data. 

The final data provided shows a summary of the changes documented in each quarter of the stocks. It makes the overall data easier to understand and manage.
